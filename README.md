# RC4-Decryption-and-Cracking-Engine
The goal is to crack the ARC4 cipher by testing keys to decrypt a given ciphertext. A module is created to check all possible keys, starting from 'h000000'. Once the correct key is found, the module outputs the plaintext in readable ASCII text. The key space is small, making brute-force feasible.
